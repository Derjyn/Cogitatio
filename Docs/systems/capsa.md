Capsa is an inventory system. While at a basic level, your run-of-the-mill inventory system can be created using Capsa, the higher-level goal of physical inventory items was conceptualized. Inventory objects (such as weapons, ammo, food, etc) have weight, take up volume, and can effect the world around them more than a simple icon on a bar or in a menu. A lot of thought is going into Capsa, with the vision to give more tangible value to items a player might acquire.
