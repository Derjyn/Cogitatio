Rector is a utility plugin, that detects any other active Cogitatio plugins and organizes their settings and functionality in the Unreal Engine editor for easier access. It is also capable of handling the life of a plugin: the startup, update, and shutdown, if desired. A high-level goal with each Cogitatio plugin is to make them self-managing by default, but allow you to manually handle their lifetime if desired. If enabled in Rector's settings, any plugins set to be self-managed will be watched by Rector and optimally started, updated and stopped.
