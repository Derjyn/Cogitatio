_air, climate, atmosphere_

Aer is a weather and atmospherics plugin. Originally, night and day cycle functionality was going to be handled in Hora, but weather and atmospherics have such a close relationship with the sun and moon, that it made more sense to move that functionality into Aer. On top of weather, atmospherics, and night/day cycles, other visual (and not-so-visual) elements such as shooting stars are in the works.
