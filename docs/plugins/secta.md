_way, path, course_

Secta is a mapping, directions and waypointing plugin. Level editors can place landmarks, and various points-of-interest in the world, and Secta can read these actors to guide players. How you decide to present the player with waypoints and such is up to you, but work is going into GPS maps, old-style paper maps, floating on-screen arrows, etc.
