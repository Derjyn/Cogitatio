_offspring, family, branch_

Stirpis is a character genetics plugin, for creating traits that can be combined or passed down to future generations of AI characters or NPCs.
Initially it will be simple- passing down or combining traits such as character height for example. The final vision for Stirpis, is
more complex, with a deep list of possible character traits and how they might interact determing the next generation's traits.
