_throw, hurl, fling_

Proicio is an advanced ballistics plugin. Projectiles can be defined, with several variable settings that will control their velocity, penetration, ricochet, and many other characteristics. A ton of research went into real-world ballistics maths and traits, and work is being done to approximate a lot of it down into more performance-friendly functionality.
