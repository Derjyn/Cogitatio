_feeling, thought, disposition_

With Fera handling "wildlife" simulation, we have Sensus handling the more human side of artificial life. The goal with Sensus is to give NPCs memory, unique attitudes, likes/dislikes, and so on. By developing a few basic needs, desires and fears for an NPC, the level of interaction with an otherwise cookie-cutter armor vendor can suddenly become quite interesting. The effects of player choices and world events can give rise to more emergent gameplay. Very much in the concept stages.
