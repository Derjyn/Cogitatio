_aid, support, resource_

Auxilium is an infrastructure plugin. Types of resources can be defined, which are utilized by other actors (referred to as an **appliance**) to modify functionality. A simple example would be a **generator appliance** requiring the presence of a **fuel resource**. A third type in the mix is an **alterant**, which can modify the traits of resources and appliances. Appliances can require more than one resource, and can even generate a new resource, based on the input resources and alterants.
