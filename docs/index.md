<h1 class="fa-h1 home">Cogitatio Overview</h1>

_design, meditation_

Cogitatio is a suite of systems for Unreal Engine that handles some common and not-so-common tasks, as well as
introducing helpful features to aid in making games and interactive applications. Many of the systems are
capable of operating by themselves, while others can interact with each other to expose more powerful
functionality.

One of the optional systems, Rector, is a central control panel of sorts for managing higher-level settings
and interactions between any utilized Cogitatio systems. While not necessary, Rector is intended to be a convenient
hub for configuring Cogitatio systems.
