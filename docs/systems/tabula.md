_way, path, course_

Tabula is a mapping, directions and waypointing plugin. Level editors can place landmarks, and various points-of-interest in the world, and Tabula can read these actors to guide players. How you decide to present the player with waypoints and such is up to you, but work is going into GPS maps, old-style paper maps, floating on-screen arrows, etc. NPCs will also be able to tap into Tabula for navigation needs.
