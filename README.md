# Cogitatio

Cogitatio is a suite of systems for Unreal Engine that introduces some commonly found features in games. Some systems are capable of empowering one another, exposing new (or enhancing existing) functionality when present.

Below is a list of the systems currently in Wdevelopment, followed by a short description of each. You may have noticed that a latin naming scheme was chosen. The rough translation is available in the descriptions for each system. Cogitatio itself roughly translates as "_thought, plan, design_".
